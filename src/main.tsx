 * ============================================================================
 * STEP 1.1: Application Entry Point - React 18 Root API
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * CREATED: Project Setup Phase - Step 1.1 (Vite project creation)
 * PURPOSE: Entry point that renders our React app to the DOM
 * STATUS: Will be enhanced with routing and context providers
 * 
 * This file demonstrates fundamental React concepts:
 * 
 * 1. APPLICATION BOOTSTRAPPING:
 *    - How React apps are mounted to the DOM
 *    - React 18's new createRoot API (vs legacy ReactDOM.render)
 *    - Entry point of the entire application
 * 
 * 2. REACT 18 FEATURES:
 *    - createRoot: New root API for better performance
 *    - StrictMode: Development tool for catching problems
 *    - Concurrent Features: Automatic batching, Suspense, etc.
 * 
 * 3. DOM MANIPULATION:
 *    - document.getElementById('root'): Gets HTML element
 *    - Non-null assertion (!): TypeScript operator
 *    - render(): Mounts React component to DOM
 * 
 * 4. COMPONENT TREE:
 *    - App component is the root of our component tree
 *    - All other components will be children of App
 *    - Component hierarchy starts here
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES:
 * - This is where React takes over the DOM
 * - The 'root' element is defined in index.html
 * - StrictMode helps catch bugs in development
 * - This file rarely changes once set up

/**
 * React StrictMode Import
 * - StrictMode: Development tool that helps catch problems
 * - Wraps components to enable additional checks and warnings
 * - Only runs in development mode (not in production)
 * - Helps identify unsafe lifecycles, legacy API usage, etc.
 */
import { StrictMode } from 'react'

/**
 * React DOM createRoot Import
 * - createRoot: React 18's new root API (replaces ReactDOM.render)
 * - Better performance and enables concurrent features
 * - More flexible than the legacy API
 * - Required for React 18+ applications
 */
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

/**
 * Global CSS Import
 * - index.css: Global styles for the entire application
 * - Applied to the entire app, not component-specific
 * - Contains CSS reset, base styles, and global variables
 * - Imported here so it's available everywhere
 */
import './index.css'

/**
 * Main App Component Import
 * - App: Our main application component (default export)
 * - .tsx extension: TypeScript React file
 * - This is the root component of our entire app
 * - All other components will be children of App
 */
import App from './App.tsx'

/**
 * React App Mounting - How React Takes Over the DOM
 * 
 * CREATED: Step 1.1 - Vite template creation
 * PURPOSE: Mount our React app to the DOM
 * 
 * Step-by-Step Breakdown:
 * 1. document.getElementById('root'): Gets the HTML element with id="root"
 * 2. ! (non-null assertion): Tells TypeScript this element exists
 * 3. createRoot(): Creates a React root for the element
 * 4. render(): Renders our App component to that root
 * 5. StrictMode: Wraps App for development checks
 * 
 * Why This Matters:
 * - This is where React takes control of the DOM
 * - The 'root' element is defined in public/index.html
 * - All React components will be rendered inside this root
 * - This is the bridge between HTML and React
 * 
 * React 18 Benefits:
 * - Better performance with automatic batching
 * - Concurrent features (Suspense, transitions)
 * - Better error boundaries and recovery
 * - More flexible rendering options

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,

/**
 * WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
 * 1. React finds the <div id="root"> in index.html
 * 2. Creates a React root for that element
 * 3. Renders the App component inside StrictMode
 * 4. App component renders its JSX
 * 5. React updates the DOM with the rendered content
 * 6. User sees the React application
 * 
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * - Add React Router for navigation
 * - Add Context providers for state management
 * - Add error boundaries for error handling
 * - Add service worker for offline functionality
